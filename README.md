# Gravity Simulation

A Python simulation of gravitational interactions between multiple particles using Pygame for visualization.

## Features

- Simulates N-body gravitational interactions
- Real-time visualization using Pygame
- Configurable gravitational constant (G) and time frame
- Reads initial particle data from CSV files
- Accurate physics calculations including:
  - Gravitational acceleration
  - Velocity updates
  - Position updates

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame
- Pandas
- Math (standard library)
- Time (standard library)
- Copy (standard library)


## Usage

Prepare a CSV file with initial particle data containing:
- mass (float)
- xcor (x-coordinate, float)
- ycor (y-coordinate, float)
- xspeed (x-velocity, float)
- yspeed (y-velocity, float)
